# Spark Procedural Animation

### Spark AR Studio - AR Library for procedural animations with 3D characters

Procedural Animation is a type of computer animation that uses mathematical algorithms to generate animation in real-time, rather than using predefined animations that are stored in memory. Procedural animation allows for more diverse and realistic actions and movements of characters and objects in a virtual environment. Procedural animation can use techniques such as inverse kinematics, physics simulation, noise functions, and aligning motion to input, as well as introduce randomness.
